Hello, my name is Eva Guleac and I am a chemistry student at EPFL. I am Romanian but I have lived my whole life until now in Belgium. I love sports, especially football, and I play in a team. I also started bouldering recently and fell in love with it, despite being slighlty scared of heights. I also love music and play the piano.
